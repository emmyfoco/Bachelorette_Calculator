## Description
```
I created this page as a gift for my best friend, who is getting married.  I am organizing her bachelorette party from 1,000 miles away, and wanted it to be easy for all her friends, scattered across the country, to find info about the party.  The most useful part is the party cost calculator that will tell them how much they can expect to spend on the whole weekend.

```
## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. .section: this class is assigned to four divs with different IDs that represent the four main sections of content, and which are tied to the list items in the main nav at the top of the page.

2. 

class name ex( .main-info-section )
.. what class does, ex( adds padding & changes background color of .main-info-section )



```
