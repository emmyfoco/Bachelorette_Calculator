## Description
```
I created this page to help me organize my best friend's bachelorette party from 1,000 miles away; her friends are scattered across the country and they needed an easy place to find info and plan their trip. The most useful part is the party cost calculator that will let them answer some questions and find out how much they can expect to spend on the whole weekend, so they can budget.

```
## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. .section: this class is assigned to four divs with different IDs that represent the four main sections of content, and which are tied to the list items in the main nav at the top of the page.

2. 

class name ex( .main-info-section )
.. what class does, ex( adds padding & changes background color of .main-info-section )



```
## Custom CSS IDs

The IDs I created are:

1. #top 
2. #main-header 
3. #intro 
4. #basicInfo 
5. #calculator 
6. #food 
7. #morning
8. #main-footer 

```
## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:
